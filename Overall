# E-Commerence-Sales

Objective: The owner of Raghav Store wants to help them create a dashboard to track and analyze their online sales across India.

My learning from this project are:

Created an interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data
Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers
Created connections, join new tables, calculations to manipulate data and enable user-driven parameters for visualizations
Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers, etc)
Overall, the guided project was a great learning experience and learned the potential of Power BI as a powerful tool for creating effective dashboards.
